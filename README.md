## IMPORTANT!

On some computers we have faced an issue with special characters. If special characters æ, ø, å does not work/look weird this can be fixed in IntelliJ by creating a run configuration in the following way:

1: Go to the tab to the left of the run icon and select edit configurations

2: click on the plus icon and select Application

3: Fill out module info and Main class

4: Go to modify options and select add VM options

5: paste the following into VM options: -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8

## USER INSTRUCTIONS
1) To run the app, download the zip, extract all.
2) Open the file folder in IDE (We use Intellij) and open the following: app/src/main/java/handin2/app
3) From here, run current file and the app will start.
4) From the first scene, either press start to load a default binary file of Bornholm. 
5) Or load one of your own files. It can be osm or obj files. Doesn't matter if they are zipped. 
6) Enjoy :)
